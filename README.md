# backshot.rb
Snapshot-style cross-linking directory tree backups

Creates backup snapshots which are ordinary directory trees, with identical files cross-linked to save space.

For each source path in a backup set, a copy of the full tree from that point is created at the corresponding path in the snapshot; when a file is identical to the same relative path in any previous snapshot, the entry in the new snapshot is a hard link to the entry in that previous snapshot.  Subdirectories are traversed.  Symlinks are backed up as symlinks, they are never followed.  Sockets and fifos are omitted. All other types (notably regular files and devices) are duplicated using tools appropriate to each backup set.

Storing backups as regular files in ordinary directory trees means no special tools are needed to access, remove, or modify backups.  (Special tools may still add convenience.)  If you want better storage efficiency at the expense of not storing snapshots on the regular filesystem, use BackupPC: <https://backuppc.github.io/backuppc/>.

When file metadata changes but file content does not, changes to the inode-associated metadata is not preserved in the new snapshot; the new snapshot contains a link to the older inode.  If you want to spend the storage space to make an additional copy of such files in order to preserve all metadata, use rsnapshot: <http://rsnapshot.org/>.

If you are running on OS X you must supply Linux-style `df` and `cp` commands;for example, install [macports](https://www.macports.org/) coreutils, and put `/opt/local/libexec/gnubin` first in the path.  If you are backing up user home directories, you will likely want to exclude `~/.gvfs` for each user.  If the filesystem your snapshots are stored on supports `lchmod` and/or `lchown`, you should enable those features in your configuration.  If you synchronize your userlists, ownership and permissions in the backup will match the source.  If not, the ownership and permissions might be confusing, but the data will not be affected.

Some methods have `rdoc`-comments

## Configuration

Currently, the configuration must be loaded from `config.rb` in the same directory as `backshot.rb` (see [TODOs](#pre-github-todo-list)).  Most values have no defaults, so the boilerplateitems must be included.

Example configuration:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/ruby1.9 -wKU
# encoding: UTF-8

{
	:superuser => :maybe,
	:mountroot => "/mnt",  # used for remote sets with no specified mountpoint, creates "#{$mountroot}/#{foo}"; no remote sets in this example
	:prefix => ".#BackShot.#{$$}#.", # prefix for temp file names
	:dateout => "%a %Y-%b-%d %H:%M:%S (%Z)",
	:root => "/volumes/backup/versions",
	:verbose => true,
	:thinning => 27, # when hardlinking from new snapshot to old snapshot, only consider this many old snapshots (after a few years of nightly backups, the long list makes things slow); chooses at random, with more recent snapshots more likely and most recent always included

## Pre-Github TODO list

- option to show progress / current file during backup
  - show running count and expected total (%?) for reference
- show times for each step (at least when verbose)
- redundency tracking:
  - load from all prior versions on start; path => redundent-with
    - when redundancy information is missing, regenerate for two oldest for which it is missing
  - in coiterate, skip branches redundant with existing version (do not skip when redundant with versions which have dissapeared)
  - when all entries in a directory are redundant with the same version, the directory is redundant with that version
  - when a directory is not redundant but has subdirectories that are, add the subdirectories to the tracking list
  - store tracking list at finish
  - add columns to final report: age, some redundency metric (maybe prune count & graph count)
- split out configuration file (search /etc/backshot.conf, /etc/sysconfig/backshot, ./backshot.conf)
- add options for lchmod & lchown
  - absent or unrecognised value means no; "yes", "true", "attempt", "implemented", etc mean yes

  - add option to automatically purge
- add moved file detection & crosslinking:
  - load checksum lists on start
    - when checksum information is missing, regenerate for two oldest for which is it missing
